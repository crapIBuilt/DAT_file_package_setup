Both scripts run with one argument. Can encode any file normally except
zip files as they are treated as executables. example: 
"python3 packer.py <input files>" This will output a .DAT file named
like this "<zipfilename>_<inputfileextension>.DAT
Everything starting with the underscore is critical to regeneration
of the file as it indicates the final file extension. 

Running unpackerrunner.py will regenerate the original file with
its original file name assuming the .DAT file name hasnt been modified.
Usage: "python3 unpackerrunner.py <DAT file>"
It will unpack and restore the original file from the DAT file. 

FOR ZIP FILES:::::::
The packer utility treats zip files identically but the unpackerrunner has
code designed to autorun code following a specific scheme.
Zip file must have the same name as the internal folder. All zip files 
must be a zipped version of a folder. The folder must contain a single
centralized install script called "main.sh"
IT WONT BE RUN WITH ROOT
